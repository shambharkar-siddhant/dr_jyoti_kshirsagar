Add a section immediately below the doctor’s photo on the Home page.

This section should be a **full-width booking strip** that feels like part of the page (not a floating bar). 
It should visually look like a “sticky booking bar” but actually sits inline in the layout — always visible when the doctor’s picture is on screen, exactly like the one on drsuzanassarian.com.

### Design requirements
- Full-width horizontal strip.
- Slightly elevated look: light background color (#f6f6f6 or soft teal tint) with subtle shadow or border-top.
- Rounded corners (xl) if it fits the design.
- Content centered on both desktop and mobile.
- Layout on desktop: 
  [Small friendly text or tagline on left]  [Compact appointment form on right].
- Layout on mobile: stacked vertically with the form under the text.

### Content
Left side (or top on mobile):
- Friendly heading: “Book your visit” or “Ready for a brighter smile?”
- Subtext: “Send us a quick message on WhatsApp — we’ll confirm your slot soon!”

Right side (or below on mobile):
- Simple inline booking form with only three fields:
  1. Name (text input)
  2. WhatsApp Number (text input)
  3. Message (multiline text)
- Large, rounded “Book on WhatsApp” button (accent color teal or brand color).
- When clicked, button should open a WhatsApp Click-to-Chat link:
  https://wa.me/<clinic-number>?text=Hi%20Dr!%20I'm%20{Name}%20and%20I’d%20like%20to%20book%20an%20appointment.%20{Message}
- Add basic validation (non-empty fields).
- Friendly success message after submission: “We’ll get back to you soon on WhatsApp! 😊”

### Visual style
- Modern, friendly, approachable.
- Teal or turquoise accent color matching the brand.
- Minimal labels, rounded input boxes.
- Font: Poppins or Inter.
- Use soft hover and focus effects.
- Keep the overall height slim — like a subtle callout bar, not a large form section.

### Responsive behavior
- Mobile-first: inputs full width, stacked, large touch targets.
- Desktop: form fields inline, balanced spacing.
- Ensure it’s visually integrated with the doctor’s photo section (small shadow overlap is okay).

### Optional detail
- Small tooth icon or smile icon on left side of the heading.
- Subtle background gradient (white → light teal) for a premium touch.
